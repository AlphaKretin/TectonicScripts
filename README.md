# TectonicScripts
Most .txt files expected by the scripts are the PBS files from Pokemon Tectonic.
## extract_types_tribes
Extracts a list of all Pokemon longside their types, tribes, and abilities. Some tribes for 4th or branching evolutions will be blank and need to be added manually. Used to generate the data for the [team builder/coverage calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14JS_0oAJpP7EB9LrtIShvPYshig1oSVsBKCSVAVV6tc/edit?usp=sharing).
## filter_full_evo
Filters the list of all Pokemon for Pokemon that do not evolve. Used primarily to fuel the below script.
## calc_tribe_pairs
Calculates how many of each tribe pair exist amongst all fully evolved Pokemon. Uses its own data source derived from cross-referencing the above two scripts' output.
## list_tribe_pairs
Same as the above script, but lists out each Pokemon that fits the tribe pair instead.
## loop_tag
Import loop points into Ogg Vorbis music files. Relies on a `loops.txt` file generated by the tool [PyMusicLooper](https://github.com/arkrow/PyMusicLooper), using the command `pymusiclooper.exe export-points --export-to TXT --fmt SAMPLES --path [FOLDERNAME]`.
# loop_scan
Scans the Tectonic music folder for Ogg files without a LOOPSTART tag and saves the list, to guide use of the above tool.
